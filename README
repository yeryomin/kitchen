Kitchen is a tool to build customized OpenWrt firmwares.

How to add a new target
-----------------------

Let's assume you want to add a new target named <name>.

1. Create directory targets/<name>/
2. Create file targets/<name>/version containing OpenWrt git hash (long),
   branch name or tag.
3. Create directory targets/<name>/configs/ and place at least one OpenWrt
   config there with appropriate name(s). The config can be a full
   configuration (e.g. a result from `make menuconfig'), a minimal
   configuration (e.g. only defining a target) or even empty file
   as in example target named master (which will build a latest OpenWrt
   with default configuration).

Optionally:
4. Place OpenWrt patches to targets/<name>/patches/
5. Place new files under targets/<name>/files/. Structure of
   targets/<name>/files/ directory should be the same as openwrt/
   To remove files existing in OpenWrt directory create a list in
   targets/<name>/files/remove with file names (relative to openwrt/)
   to delete.
6. Place files/patches which are common for all your targets into
   targets/common/ directory
7. Add env file containing environment configuration.
   See env.example for reference
8. Add targets/<name>/src file containing string pointing to OpenWrt git
   repository e.g.: git://git.openwrt.org/openwrt.git (default)


How to use
----------

Specifying Kitchen make targets is very similar to OpenWrt, e.g.:

   make <target>/<profile>/<action> <params>

First try simply running `make'. It should detect all your targets and profiles.
There are three main actions:
1. prepare - will prepare (download/patch/copy) OpenWrt files
2. compile - will compile OpenWrt as prepared
3. update - update kitchen target from targets/

Other actions are:
1. clean - runs clean under OpenWrt
2. dirclean - runs dirclean under OpenWrt
3. distclean - runs distclean under OpenWrt

Normally you should not need the latter three.

compile, and all clean actions will forward make params to OpenWrt.
E.g. `make master/default/compile V=s -j12' is identical to running
`make V=s -j12' under OpenWrt directory.
